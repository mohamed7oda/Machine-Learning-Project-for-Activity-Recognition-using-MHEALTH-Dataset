# Machine-Learning-Project-for-Activity-Recognition-using-MHEALTH-Dataset
Project titled "Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Activity Recognition using the MHEALTH Dataset." The MHEALTH (Mobile HEALTH) dataset contains recordings of body motion and vital signs from ten volunteers performing various physical activities. Sensors on the chest, right wrist, and left ankle measure acceleration, rotation, and magnetic field orientation, while the chest sensor also provides 2-lead ECG data for heart monitoring and exercise impact analysis.

In this project, we need to use machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Logistic Regression to perform Activity Recognition and compare the performance of each model. First, I performed exploration of the data and executed cleaning and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, handling duplicates, balancing the data, and feature selection. After that, Visualized the data using heatmap. Then, Splited the data into features and target variables and divided it into training and testing sets. Next, I fed the data into the five models: K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Linear Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN), and Logistic Regression. Afterward, Evaluated each model by calculating the accuracy, recall, F1 Score, mean squared error, and cross-validation scores. Finally, I plotted the confusion matrix for each model. if you want to know more details about the project you can see the Report
